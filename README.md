## Projects
- **[Machine learning model for binary classification](https://github.com/harimshin/data-science-portfolio/blob/main/machine_learning_binary_classification_with_SMOTE_prediction_model_for_the_severity_of_car_accidents.ipynb) (dataset: [US car accidents](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/sobhanmoosavi/us-accidents))**<br>
  Developed a robust machine learning model for a large dataset of 2.8 million records, focusing on binary classification. Employed feature engineering and hyperparameter tuning to select the optimal model. Implemented SMOTE
to effectively address class imbalance in the target variable. (PySpark)
