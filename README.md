### Projects
- **[Machine learning model for binary classification](https://github.com/harimshin/data-science-portfolio/blob/b3018ee7cfca60c0d11572d2bb487f62604b1214/machine_learning_binary_classification_with_SMOTE_prediction_model_for_the_severity_of_car_accidents.ipynb) (dataset: [US car accidents](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/sobhanmoosavi/us-accidents))**<br>
  Developed a robust machine learning model for a large dataset of 2.8 million records, focusing on binary classifica-
tion. Employed feature engineering and hyperparameter tuning to select the optimal model. Implemented SMOTE
to effectively address class imbalance in the target variable. (PySpark)
- **[Monitoring plan design for gradient boosting model](https://github.com/harimshin/data-science-portfolio/blob/main/mlops_model_risk_management_monitoring_plan_gradient_boosting_model_for_pima_diabetes.ipynb)
(dataset: [Pima Indians diabetes](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/uciml/pima-indians-diabetes-database))**<br>
Designed a comprehensive monitoring plan for a gradient boosting model, including data drift detection, perfor-
mance tracking, sensitivity analysis, and conceptual soundness checks. (Scikit-Learn, Scipy, Statsmodels)
