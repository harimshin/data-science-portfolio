## Projects
- **[Machine learning model for binary classification](https://github.com/harimshin/data-science-portfolio/blob/b3018ee7cfca60c0d11572d2bb487f62604b1214/machine_learning_binary_classification_with_SMOTE_prediction_model_for_the_severity_of_car_accidents.ipynb) (dataset: [US car accidents](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/sobhanmoosavi/us-accidents))**<br>
  Developed a robust machine learning model for a large dataset of 2.8 million records, focusing on binary classifica-
tion. Employed feature engineering and hyperparameter tuning to select the optimal model. Implemented SMOTE
to effectively address class imbalance in the target variable. (PySpark)
- **[Monitoring plan design for gradient boosting model](https://github.com/harimshin/data-science-portfolio/blob/main/mlops_model_risk_management_monitoring_plan_gradient_boosting_model_for_pima_diabetes.ipynb)
(dataset: [Pima Indians diabetes](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/uciml/pima-indians-diabetes-database))**<br>
Designed a comprehensive monitoring plan for a gradient boosting model, including data drift detection, perfor-
mance tracking, sensitivity analysis, and conceptual soundness checks. (Scikit-Learn, Scipy, Statsmodels)

## Work Experience
**Doctoral Researcher / Instructor @ Syracuse University (Syracuse, NY) (_Aug 2017 - Present_)**
- Utilized a zero-inflated Poisson model to suggest a policy design to enhance the profitability of the referral program
by analyzing shifts in customersâ€™ opportunistic behavior. (R)
- Led a SAS programming workshop to train graduate students to analyze Nielsen Consumer Panel Data and
create customer insights. (SAS)
- Guided student teams through the successful completion of marketing strategy projects by assisting in defining
marketing problems, conducting marketing environment analyses, and devising marketing strategies.

**Data Analyst / Digital Marketing & Business Development Lead @ Kakao Entertainment (Seoul, Korea) (_May 2013 - Feb 2015_)**
- Improved the ROI of the marketing campaigns  by analyzing their effects from traffic, product, and revenue
perspectives and providing data-driven decision support for marketing, product, and sales leaders
- Acquired new users and bolstered the revenue YoY by designing and implementing digital marketing
campaigns such as social media advertisements, banner advertisements, and push notifications.
- Enhanced the conversion rate of push notification marketing by developing a customer segmentation system
of the MarTech product based on purchase history as a project manager.
- Increased the MAU of the e-books & podcasts categories by finding, selecting, and marketing 200+ products
and developing merchandising initiatives with vendors.

**Research Assistant @ Korea Productivity Center (Seoul, Korea) (_Aug 2012 - Dec 2012_)**
- Collected quantitative and qualitative customer data from surveys, focus group interviews, mystery shopping
exercises, and interviews with employees, collaborating with marketing research agencies.
- Generated actionable customer insights from collected data, assisting consultants in devising strategic initiatives
